<!-- # Lab | Case Study -->

## Introduction

We saw before a brief case study of PowerBI and usage of some content that we already saw in the week. Now, after we have created a previous analysis, and we clean our data, we want to go deeper into it.

<br>

## Challenge 1 - Visualizations

<br>

To start drawing your visualization, be sure that you are going to use the original dataset, not the filtered one. Your initial goals are:

- Create a Line Chart where we can see our category most sold (of the whole dataset)
- Use a TOP N filter where the diff between state bottle cost and state bottle retail is higher (show only the top 5)
- Now, to the previous line chart, add a line with average diff retail cost to see how much the difference is. You can use the Analytics panel of PowerBI to calculate this faster.
- Create a Map using Map from PowerBI. Use City as location and Sale(Dollars) in size.
- Then to the same using _Arcgis_. Look for the option to filter it only for information of US and you will notice the huge difference!
- After our maps exercise, we would like to create bins. Bins are groups into PowerBI that allow us to see how is distributed our data through the whole database from a single field.
  - Create a Group field of Sales (Dollars)
  - If you want, you could let PowerBI automatically calculate the best number of bins.
- Now, you must create a pie chart to see the average importance of each bin.
- As you see, we have a huge group that goes from 0 to 400 USD so we are going to exclude it from the chart.

## Challenge 2 - Business Sense

<br>

You've created so far graphics that have many potentials to be explored and that you can get a lot of information from them. Now we need to do the most difficult part... Analyze and explain! This is an open challenge where you have to explain what you understand about your graphics but keep in count the following bullets:

- **Clarity**: The story has to be as easy as possible to follow, even though the analysis has been tedious and long.
- **Relevance**: Depending on the objective of your story, you will have to be able to bring up the necessary data.
- **History**: For this, the images must be impressive following the taste of your viewers. And in addition, you will have to tell a story that your audience wants to hear.
- **Images and words**: The idea is that you convey in words what you want your audience to record in their mind, and also accompany those words with images that further facilitate their understanding.

## Deliverables

Try to explain this in two or the paragraphs and add it as `my_case_study.pptx` or `my_case_study.docx`.
