<!-- # Lab | Conditional Formatting -->

## Introduction

With conditional formatting for tables in Power BI Desktop, you can specify customized cell colors, including color gradients, based on field values. You can also represent cell values with data bars or KPI icons or as active web links. You can apply conditional formatting to any text or data field, as long as you base the formatting on a field that has a numeric, color name or hex code, or web URL values.

When we apply this technique to the different charts in a report, we can significantly improve the visual appeal of our reports. This could be thought of as a building block to improving reports.

# Prerequisites

- At this point, you should have installed Power BI on your laptop
- Open `age_specific_genres.xlsx` file

**Note**: You can find the file in the [Power BI resources](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/power-bi-resources/tree/master/tallest_buildings_all_resources) repository.

If you have any doubts about the prerequisites, please clarify with your instructor or teaching assistants.'

## Challenge 1 - Apply conditional formatting

<br>

In this challenge, we will practice conditional formatting.
These guidances are helpful to train your problem-solving thinking and to learn how to work around problems.

Below is an overview of the steps:

- Using the `age_specific_genres.xlsx` file in the above folder create a matrix showing the Count of films by Certificate rating and Genre.

<br>

Your matrix will have all the certificates listed.

<br>

You now have a more familiar order.

## Challenge 2 - More and More Visualization

<br>

Start by creating the following chart, or as close to it as you can get.

<br>

Color saturation has been set to color charts according to Oscars Wins, and data labels applied outside each one.

Now let's create the following chart where we want to display if the budget is proportional to the number of Oscar wins, in other words, when the budget was bigger the movie won more Oscars.

<br>

Now you can answer which genre is the most awarded and if the budget was proportional to the number of wins.

When you finish the last 3 tables/visualizations you can filter all when you select any Genre on Pie Chart, for example.
