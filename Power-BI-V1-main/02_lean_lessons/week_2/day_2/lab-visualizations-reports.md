<!-- # Lab | Visualizations - Reports -->

## Introduction

A graph might look great, but that doesn’t mean it presents information in a way that can be easily understood and analyzed. And there’s nothing more frustrating than staring at a chart wondering what you’re supposed to get out of it.

Data visualizations should organize and present data in a coherent manner so the audience can make sense of what’s going on and take action. As organizations collect more and more data, visualizations are increasingly vital to communicate real-time, actionable insights.

# Prerequisites

- At this point you should have installed Power BI on your laptop
- Open `populations.xlsx` file.
- Open `big_beasts.pbix` file.

**Note**: Both of these files you can find in the [Power BI resources](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/power-bi-resources/tree/master/tallest_buildings_all_resources) repository and `reports_all_resources` sub-repository.

If you have any doubts about the prerequisites, please clarify with your instructor or teaching assistants.

In this challenge, we will practice creating create a donut chart using the populations data, and morph this into a tree chart.

Below is an overview of the steps:

1. Create a new Power BI Desktop file, and load the Excel workbook in the above folder into it.

## Challenge 2 - Create a bar chart

<br>

1. Open the Power BI report (Big beasts) in the above folder. As the text box at the top of the report says - this contains a list of skyscrapers taken from Wikipedia.
