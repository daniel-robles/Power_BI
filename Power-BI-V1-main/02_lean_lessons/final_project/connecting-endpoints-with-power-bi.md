Please follow the steps below to see how we can connect endpoints to Power BI.

1. Open Power BI Desktop. Go to Power Query editor using Transform Data:

<br>

4. This will open a new blank query for you:

<br>

5. Edit the query as shown below. This is where you will give the endpoint as a string. We are using a dummy example in this case:

<br>

6. Since you have added a basic authentication requirement to connect to your endpoint, you would need to enter your credentials to Power BI as shown below. Here you should use your username and password:

<br>

7. Next you will see a series of snapshots. This will load the data from the endpoint into Power BI. Expand the table as shown.
