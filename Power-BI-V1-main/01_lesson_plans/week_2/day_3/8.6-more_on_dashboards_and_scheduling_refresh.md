# Lesson 8.6 - More on Dashboards and Scheduling Refresh

<br><br>

### Lesson Duration: 4 hours (including Lab)

<br>

- **Purpose**: The purpose of this lesson is to get students acquainted with more complex approaches to creating dashboards, such as creating them from multiple reports. Students will have a hands-on practice on creating and sharing dashboards and will learn how to set up scheduled refreshes so the dashboard stays up to date.

<br>

## Pre-requisites

To successfully take this class, the students would need:

- Completed all previous lessons, labs and activities
- Power BI Desktop Installed
- Power BI service active
- Access to all datasets used in class and lab (students have access to this [repository](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/power-bi-resources) - liked to their Student Portal)

---

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:

- Understand how dashboards can be created from multiple reports
- Share dashboards
- Use Scheduled Refresh

<br>

We can add visualizations from multiple reports to a Power BI dashboard. To do it, you would first have to publish that report from your Power BI desktop and then use Power BI service to add visuals as shown in the previous lessons.

> :exclamation: Note for instructor: In this example we are adding some visual from the `sales_analysis_report.pbix` which we published to our account earlier. We will add this to our dashboard `dash_1_test`.

**Note**: Please note that this is just an example to show how it could be done. This might not make too much business sense here.

<br>

**Note**: Please note that when you click on any visualization on your dashboard, it will take you back to the original report from where you added it.

<br>

- You can drag around and move a tile if you like.

<br>

- There is another really fun feature in Power BI called "**Ask a question about your data**". It intelligently searches your data and based on its context-dependent keyword search for table, column, and calculated field names, it can build smart filters, can sort data, aggregate, group, and display data.

To use it, click on "Ask a question about your data" search bar and it will give you some pre-determined questions. Click on those questions to see some quick visualizations.

> :exclamation: Note for instructor: To share your dashboards, you would need a Power BI Pro account. You can use the trial version for free for 60 days for now.

<br>
    
    
- Click on share. If you get a prompt for using Power BI pro, select "Try Free".

<br>  
    
As we saw earlier, [powerbi.com]powerbi.com offers us the connection to digitalized world and our dashboards. We saw how to publish our dashboard from desktop to the cloud and now we're going to see how to update them automatically by using the main settings of Power Bi online. 
    
On your account on PowerBI.com, you can manipulate with different options but the most important are:

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day3_settings_1.png)

<br>

- **Manage Embed Codes** - shows the code we have shared before. We can disable this and delete previous shared reports.
- **Manage Personal Storage** - shows how much storage does each report take. Here we can find details about our license agreement for Power BI.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day3_embed_1.png)

<br>

- **Settings** - allows the access to configure different setting options inside PowerBI.com. Some of the main settings are:
  - **General** - allows you to modify some of the default settings such as language, etc.
  - **Datasets** - shows all your available datasets. You will see one dataset per notebook published here.

Now that we've seen the main options inside settings, we are going to go deeper on scheduling refresh. To set up a scheduled refresh, you must be on `Settings --> Datasets`. Once you are here, you will see all your available datasets.

<br>

In front of them, there is a couple of options to set the configuration for each one and the main ones that we will be using are:

- **Gateway Connection**: Gateways are the "door" between PowerBI and our local data sources.
- **Scheduled Refresh**: It allows us to configure the refresh for our dashboards. If our database is local, we must configure the gateway before scheduling refresh. If not, we can do it and select the different option that it has:

  - **Refresh Frequency**: How often do you want your report to be updated
  - **Timezone**: Timezone you want to use to refresh
  - **Send refresh failure notifications**: People who should be concerned if something fails.
