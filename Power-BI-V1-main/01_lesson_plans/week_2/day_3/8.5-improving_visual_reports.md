<br>
 
### Conditional Formatting 
    
One important feature of Power BI is conditional formatting. It helps us to fast detect the range between our values and where we have a concentration of them. We can use different rules to highlight values of interest in the whole data.

Follow the steps listed below to set it up:

1. Select matrix from the visualizations pane. Add country to rows, products to columns, and Sales to values.

<br>

<br>

2. Click on the focus mode to zoom in on the data.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day3_conditional_format_3.png)

<br>

3. Go to the values section, and in the drop-down select "Conditional Formatting". Select Background color.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day3_conditional_format_5.png)

<br>

4. Select Format By Color Scale and use the defaults for now. Click Ok.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day3_conditional_format_6.png)

<br>

5. Now your matrix has the conditional format you wanted. You can click on "Back to Report" to move back to the page.

<br>

Another way of conditional formatting is using Data Bars Option.

<summary> Click for Session Details: Visual Appeal </summary>

<br>
 
#### Visual appeal

Some important things to keep in mind while creating plots/reports/dashboards are:

- Try always to use the same palette of colors.

  - This prevents us from being distracted by too many different colors

- Your text shouldn't be too big.

  - If a specific text is bigger than another, it'll focus our attention on it. Usually, the biggest and different ones should be the titles and subtitles.

- Use the elements that Power BI has to complement your dashboard.

  - Make use of elements like Image and Text Box which allow you to import your own images and create your own labels.

- Use correct visuals for the data you're showing.

  - It's important to keep in count the "Choosing the right visualizations" techniques (previously seen in the class).

- Use different visual throughout your report

  - Try to use different visualizations if it's possible. Explore what are the ways to use visuals from Power BI Visuals that help your dashboard to stand out.

Let's say we have this simple report. We added a couple more plots there. One is a Donut chart of Sales by Product, Clustered Column Chart of Sales by Segment. Then there is a card on the top.

> :exclamation: Note for instructor: Ask students to recreate this and then we will make some changes in this to make it more visually appealing. You can also use this file directly `sales_analysis_report.pbix`.

### Themes

Usage of Power BI Themes will help you to configure your whole report in the same format. Use them once you finish making the report.
Just a quick heads up that you have to be careful about conditional formatting. You might lose some conditional format when using some themes.

<br>

In the example below, you will find two reports: one BEFORE the changes were applied and one AFTER the changes were applied.

Can you spot the difference?

Can you identify how those changes can be applied to a report? In the Power BI interface, can you find where and how can you do it?

- BEFORE

### Session 2

> üï∞Ô∏è 40 min

#### Key Concepts

- Using Power BI Service
- Publishing Report from Power BI Desktop

<details>
<summary> Click for Details: Power BI Service </summary>

<br>

Power BI offers a suite of services that allows you to get the most of your data in a single place, some benefits are:

- You can now create your own dashboards, make them interactive.
- Share it seconds with people inside your organizations.
- Embed your reports in your app/web page.

For now, we have been using Power BI Desktop but now we will get familiarized with some other Power BI tools. Our goal is to publish the report from the Power BI desktop to PowerBI.com to have access to all capabilities from the cloud. To do this, you must follow these steps:

1. Open your report on PowerBI Desktop
2. Go to Home, then to share click on Publish

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day3_publish_1.png)

<br>

4. Save your changes and then proceed to login, using your e-mail and password. If you have not made an account yet, please create one. You can get a free trial version of Power BI Pro for 60 days. Here is a link for [Power BI Pro](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi-pro/) trial version. Create an account here as we will later use Power BI Pro to create visualizations and embed them on a web page. That requires using a PRO account.
5. After you have created an account when you go to Publish it will ask you to Select a Destination. You can choose the default destination for now.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day3_publish_2.png)

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day3_publish_3.png)

<br>

The report will be uploaded to your workspace and you can start sharing it!

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day3_publish_4.png)

<br>

6. Click on the link to open the report in the browser, inside the Power BI desktop.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day3_publish_5.png)

<br>

**Note**: In a typical Power BI workflow, you begin by building a report in Power BI Desktop, then publishing it to the Power BI service. This workflow is common, but you can also create Power BI reports right in the Power BI service.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Click for Details: More Details on Power BI Service, Dashboards </summary>
 
In the Power BI service, dashboards help you keep a finger on the pulse of your business. Dashboards display tiles, which you can select to open reports for exploring further. Keep in mind that dashboards are different from reports in Power BI.

<br>

### Power BI Pro specifics

<br>
 
Now let's understand some key concepts of PowerBI pro:

- **Workspaces**: Each workspace is like a private folder unless you permit someone to access it. It will contain Dashboards and Datasets inside it.
- **Publish to web** (public): This option will help us to publish our dashboard to the web to share it with people that don't have access to Power BI pro. To do this, you must select the following: **`Dashboard --> File --> Embed Report --> Publish to web`**.

Sometimes you will need an organization admin to permit you to do the steps listed before.

- **Datasets**: Our datasets correspond to our reports - each one of these is connected to our reports and views will be updated as we make updates in datasets.

- **Shared with me**: In this section, we can see the documents that people have shared with my account.

#### Intro to Power BI Services

- Introduction to Dashboards
- Dashboards vs. Reports

<details>
  <summary>Click for Details: Dashboards Intro </summary>

<br> 
 
Dashboards can be created and shared via Power BI. It is a single canvas that contains zero or more tiles and widgets. Each tile pinned from a report or Q&A displays a single visualization that was created from a dataset and pinned to the dashboard. Entire report pages can also be pinned to a dashboard as a single tile. There are many ways to add tiles to your dashboard and to dig deeper into this topic, check the official documentation.

- Why do people create dashboards?

  Here are just some of the reasons:

  - To see, in one glance, all the information needed to make decisions.
  - To monitor the most important information about your business.
  - To ensure all colleagues are on the same page, viewing and using the same information.
  - To monitor the health of a business or product or business unit or marketing campaign, etc.
  - To create a personalized view of a larger dashboard - all the metrics that matter to you.
