# Lesson 8.4 - Power BI Reports

<br><br>

### Lesson Duration: 4 hours (including Lab)

<br>

- **Purpose**: In this lesson, students will get more hands-on experience with using and creating visuals in Power BI. The focus of this unit is on reports as a perfect way to gather multiple useful information on one spot.

<br>

## Pre-requisites

To successfully take this class, the students would need:

- Completed all previous lessons, labs and activities
- Power BI desktop
- Access to all datasets used in class and lab (students have access to this [repository](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/power-bi-resources) - liked to their Student Portal)
- **Have the plots from the previous session ready**

---

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:

- Understand usage and difference between visualizations and reports
- Format reports
- Share reports

### Using Visualizations

The visualizations inside Power BI display the data as plots and charts and helps to get insights about what's going on and what should be important for the business to take action. We have worked with this a lot until.

<br>

### Using Reports

A report is a group of visualizations that complements each other and displays multiple data into a single visual without the need for change between multiple sheets. To build a report, you can easily follow the instructions below:

1. Build all your visuals into one sheet
2. Resize your visualizations allowing them to display good into one page
3. Just drag and drop the visualization to the place you want.

<br>

#### Changing the report page size

<br>

- You can change the size of your report/sheet in: `Visualizations --> Format --> Page Size`.

**Note**: Make sure that you **have not** selected any visualization when you try to change the size of the report page.

- You can also customize it to your needs using Pixels as shown below.

<br>

#### Important

<br>

- Try not to overload your reports and visuals with too much information
- It's important to be clear and concise with your data to avoid your report load slow
- Add a title to your dashboard using the text option
- You can also add logo or images that represent the analysis or information

After changing the canvas size of the page, you can see that we have a lot of space to create visuals and explain better our topic. 
  
So let's start with a line chart.

<br>
  
- Something important when using **line charts** is to add marker - it'll allow us to see where is each equivalent to `x`-axis in `y`-axis.

<br>
  
- To complement your line, you can add a **pie chart**. This is really nice to see, for example, from our discounts how is divided by segment. So here, you can start building your story about your data and connect each visual between them.

<br>

<br>

- Now, to take advantage of all available space, let's add a bar chart next to the pie chart which will help us to see the units sold per segment and to be sure if we sell more from a specific segment it was because of the discounts. Be sure to add the labels to the bar chart to see how many units were sold.

<br>

- Finally, we can add a map that will show us the country that has the best sales.

<br>

**Note**: We are going to delete the word _cloud_ because it doesn't make sense with the information that the other visuals are showing.
