### What is a Power BI Visualization?

- Default Power BI visuals

You already are aware of the default visuals in Power BI:

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day2_default_powerBI_visuals.png)

<br>

- Microsoft AppSource

AppSource is the place for apps, add-ins, and extensions for your Microsoft software.

You can also get other visuals from **Microsoft AppSource**. Here is a link to the [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps?page=1&product=power-bi-visuals).

- PowerBI Store

Within PowerBI you can import and use a lot of graphics that were created by developers around the world. Here are certified visuals indicated by a blue checkmark and freemium visuals. Also, if applies, you can import visualizations that were created inside your organization and start using them in your dashboard.

### Extra information for Java developers

<details>
  <summary> Click for Details: Java code in visuals </summary>

<br>

- When you add a Power BI Visual in a report, you are including JavaScript/HTML5/CSS3 code written by the author of the visual into your report. This code does not have access to the database. It only receives the data assigned to the visual and only produces the rendering in an iframe tag of the report page.

- The code is included in a `PBIVIZ` file that you can download from a website. When you get the visual from the AppSource, the `PBIVIZ` file is transferred from the Microsoft marketplace or the Organizational visuals tenant repository. Each visual has a unique `ID` (`GUID`) that identifies the visual. You can see the `GUID` of a visual by choosing the About context menu with a right-click in the Visualizations pane.

- Importing a visual means you are running JavaScript code that accesses the data presented in the visualization (there is no access to other data) and could potentially use any API available to JavaScript ‚Äì including the ability to communicate to external services. As you see, security is important here.

</details>

Power BI has different categories of graphics inside the Power BI Store. We will mention the more frequently visuals used below:

- **Power BI Certified**: A certified visual is a visual whose code was inspected and approved by Microsoft, which guarantees that the custom visual satisfies the certification requirements. These requirements mainly verify that the custom visual use the right API, does not expose the user to any vulnerability, does not call external services, and does not access external resources. These are graphics that Power BI has reviewed and they certify. The other ones that are not here could be from other developers so you must be sure which graph are you importing into your report. Some examples are:

  - Word Cloud: to know the most used/mentioned word
  - Tornado Chart: to compare two attributes
  - Radar Chart: to compare multiple characteristics into one graphic
  - Filters: to add more options to filter your report
    - [Text Filter](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/wa104381309?tab=overview): to search across your dashboard
    - [Play Axis](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/wa104380981?tab=overview): to show your reports without having to click every time you want to change the values of a filter (similar to a dynamic slicer)

For this activity, we will use another dataset `population_by_zipCode_2010.xlsx`.

- Add heatmaps from Power BI Store.
- Load the data into Power BI.
- Use the heat map to see the distribution of data ie where is the data mostly collected from/ which areas?

**Hint**: In the Location (ID) section use the zip code column and the Values section, use the population column. Make sure that the aggregation on Population is Sum function.

### Session 2

> üï∞Ô∏è 40 min

#### Key Concepts

- Discussion on Choosing the right visualization

> :exclamation: Note for instructor: This session is more like an activity where the students will work in groups. Please refer to the details below.

<details>
<summary> Click for Details: Discussion on Choosing the right visualization </summary>
    
The objective of this session is to give some context to the students about when to choose the visuals and which visual do you go for.

> :exclamation: Note for instructor: We will talk about this topic in greater detail in the next session. This session is for the students to conduct their own research.

> :exclamation: Note fir instructor: Give at least 5 min per question. Then ask the group to share their answers, here is where you can interact with them and the discussion is going to flow. This should take 25 to 30 min and then we are going to share with them some advice about data visualization. Divide the class into small groups (2-3 people per group) and ask them to answer some questions like the ones below:

- Why you should use a BI tool instead of Excel?
- Read about different plots available in Power BI. (eg. pie charts, bar charts, stacked bar charts, scatter plots, and line plots. What information do these plots convey?
- How to decide which graph you should use? When do you use which plot based on the data and/or the business question?
- How could you represent more than 2 dimensions into one graph? (eg.category, price, location)
- Can a plot have multiple axes? If yes, illustrate a couple of examples when this could be useful.
- How can correct data visualization and storytelling benefit the company?

</details>

<br>

> :exclamation: Note for instructor: You can refer to these questions during the class discussion.

<br>

<br>

Some questions to ask:

- Does your graph answer an interesting question?
- Will my graph raise someone‚Äôs attention? To answer this, you will need to take the first crucial step: determine to who this graph is addressed.
- Is your graph truthful?
- Check the reliability of your data sets. Graphical choices are important:
  - Numerical units and scales: will you use percentage or absolute values? how to represent values having different scales on the same graph? where to display the units and scales used in your graph?
  - Colors: how will the chosen colors be perceived by the reader? should you rather use a continuous or a discrete color scale? which misleading interpretations could my graph lead to?
  - Text and decorators: how will you arrange frames and text elements around the graph? which text font and style do you use? how to find the right mix between too much and too little information on and around the graph?
- Does your graph teach something new in a clear way?
- Teach something new in a clear way.

### Session 3

> üï∞Ô∏è 40 min

#### Key Concepts

- Choosing the right visualization

<details>
  <summary> Click for Details: Choosing the right visualization </summary>
  
<br>

**Note**: Here we will use the `financial_sample.xlsx` file and create some visualizations.

> :exclamation: Note to the instructor: You can ask students to use a different page for each visualization. We can use the same file later to create reports. It will be covered later in the week.

When creating graphics, it becomes really difficult to pick the correct visualization. You must have clear some aspects to each one of your graphics and your data to start plotting. Below you'll find a suggestion on when to pick each of the most common visualizations:

- Pie charts:
  - Are used to show data as part of a whole
  - Could be distracting
  - Too many slices could be difficult to represent

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day2_pie.png)

<br>

- Bar charts
  - Are used to simultaneously display values of multiple variables
  - Usually better than pie charts
    - message more direct
    - easier on the eye
  - Easier to adapt for black and white printing or showing
  - Can be ordered to show more directly the magnitude of the most important variables

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day2_bar.png)

<br>

- Scatter and Line Plots
  - A Scatter plot displays 2 sets of data (X, Y for example) via a series of markers (dots for example) Each marker represents an observation.
  - A line plot is similar to a scatter plot that displays adjacent data points via a segment. The data are ordered usually via the X value.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day2_scatterandline.png)

<br>

You can use the "Format" option under the Visualizations pane to change the plot.

<br>

<br>

A simple example of Scatter Plots. They are used to study the relationship between two numerical variables. They are used to study correlations. Correlations are beyond the scope of our discussion.
