To have in count these points, be sure to follow these 4 key notes:

- _Clarity_: The story must be easy to follow. It doesn't matter how difficult was to find your insight but to note what you've found is the important part.
- _Relevance_: You must identify the most relevant of your analysis and include it into your storytelling.
- _History_: You're the storyteller of your history, so you need to create the story to make you spectator to understand what you want to share.
- _Images and words_: These key point will help you to convey in words what you want your audience to record in their mind, and also accompany those words with images that further facilitate their understanding.

> :exclamation: Note for instructor: After you explain this, you can talk about Spotify and their idea to personalize each user's story each year. This is a really good storytelling which shares with you your top musics and artists.
