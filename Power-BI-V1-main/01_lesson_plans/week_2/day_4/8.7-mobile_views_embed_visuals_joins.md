Power BI users should understand how to work with the Power BI settings and other data source settings and options available, as these configurations determine available functionality, user interface options, default behaviors, performance, and the security of the data being accessed. After you finish your Power BI desktop configuration, your know that this initial config will work perfectly for Desktop or web format.

In this session, we will what the different Power BI Desktop configuration settings are and see how to work with some of them.

1. Go to **`File --> Options and Settings --> Options`**

<br>

**GLOBAL options** are applied to all Power BI Desktop files created or accessed by the user, while **CURRENT FILE options** must be defined for each Power BI Desktop file. Some useful settings options to know about are:

- **Data Load tab**: Used to check if the currently used data cache is below the Maximum allowed (MB) setting. If it is near the limit and local disk space is available, increase the value of the Maximum allowed (MB). Do not clear the cache unless local disk space is unavailable as this will require additional, often unnecessary, queries to be executed at design time.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_configuration_4.png)

<br>

- **Query Editor tab**: Used to display both the query settings pane and the formula bar. This will allow for greater visibility to the structure and specific M functions utilized by individual queries.

  <summary> Click for Session Details: Mobile Views</summary>

<br>

> :exclamation: Note for instructor: In this lesson, you can use any Power BI file as you would like. We will quickly walk you through how to work with the Mobile view using the `sales_analysis_report.pbix` file. Students have access to this file in the [Power BI resources](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/power-bi-resources) repository.

After you finish your Power BI desktop configuration, your know that this initial config will work perfectly for Desktop or web format. Yet another good source to have in the count is the cellphone (small screens) because a lot of people use this as the main source to consult their information or to see their emails. To be sure if this will work fine when someone looks at it on their phones, Power BI has the option of _Mobile View_ which allows us to simulate our report as if it was seen on a mobile phone.

- To access here, you must click on View and then the Mobile layout. It will open a page simulating a mobile phone where you can start with the configuration.

<br>

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_mobile_1b.png)

<br>

- Then you will see your visuals from your report page where you selected Mobile Layout. Now you can drag and drop these images in to the layout and organize them as you want.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_mobile_2.png)

<br>

- After you organize them, you might realize that the text sizes are not displayed properly in the Mobile View. In that case, you would have to go back to the page layout, edit your visuals and then go to Mobile View again.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_mobile_2b.png)

<br>

- We duplicated page 1 and then made some changes to the original visuals to make suit better for the mobile view. This is how it looks in the Mobile View after the changes were applied.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_mobile_2c.png)

<br>

- When you finished your changes, you can apply here a theme, same as we learned before. You just have to click on themes and then select the theme you liked the most. It will set all views to this format.

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_mobile_t1.png)

- Now you must publish this into PowerBI.com to share it with your colleagues and to create a Dashboard inside PowerBI. To do this, as we have seen before, you must go to Home and then Publish. Here, if you already have it imported, you must click replace, it will overwrite your past dashboard and dataset so be sure when you clicked this because you can't undo this.

<br>

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_mobile_publish3.png)

<br>

- To see these changes, go to PowerBI.com and then go to "My Workspace", open the report and you can start creating dashboards and sharing your information.
- Now if you would share your dashboard, it would have the adjusted view.

We got familiarized with some Power BI Desktop configuration settings. Now, go ahead and explore:

- What are Global DirectQuery options used for?

<br>

- What are Global DirectQuery options used for?

  This enables additional DAX functions to be used in metrics against DirectQuery data models that are necessary to meet many common requirements. Although all DAX functions are supported for DirectQuery models, certain functions are not optimized for DirectQuery; they may not generate an efficient SQL query and may require local, single-threaded resources to execute

- What are the three different privacy levels for the data sources and how does it work?

  Defining data source privacy levels such as Organizational or Private prevents the data from these sources from being exposed to external or inappropriate data sources during data retrieval processes. For example, if a query calls for merging a Private data source with a Public data source, the join operation will be executed locally - the private data will not be sent to the public source. In the absence of Privacy Level settings set for data sources, the M query engine will look to optimize for performance by utilizing source system resources.

<br>

Using the Power BI "Publish to web" option, you can easily embed interactive Power BI content in blog posts, websites, emails, or social media. You can also easily edit, update, refresh, or stop sharing your published visuals.

**Note**: When you use Publish to web, anyone on the Internet can view your published report or visual. Viewing requires no authentication. It includes viewing detail-level data that your reports aggregate. Before publishing a report, make sure it's okay for you to share the data and visualizations publicly. Don't publish confidential or proprietary information. If in doubt, check your organization's policies before publishing.

To embed a visual/report online, follow these steps:

1. Open a report in a workspace select `File --> Embed report --> Publish to web` (public).

<br>

<br>

**Note**: If your Power BI admin hasn't allowed you to create embed codes, you may need to contact them.

<br>

<br>

4. In the Success dialog, you see a preview of how the report will look. Select the Size and Default page.
   You can also add a Placeholder image, to make the web page load faster. With a placeholder image, people viewing your report on the web see a View interactive content button they can select to view the report itself.
   Make those changes first. Then copy the link to send it in email, or copy the HTML to paste into a website. You can embed it in code such as an iFrame, or paste it directly into a web page or blog.

Please refer to the file [Intro to SQL Joins](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12k_oFbPgHXYa8h0mSpz5IoLRjs86bKO1/view?ts=60d9d320) to discuss the topic with the students. Students have access to the same presentation in the Student Portal.

</details>

> :exclamation: Note for instructor: Schemas in Databases are also an important concept. If you feel that you have the time to quickly go over this topic, please do. Here are some details along with the reference link that can be used directly in class. Otherwise please share this with the students.

<br>

> :exclamation: Note for instructor: Here is the link to the official docs - [Star Schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/star-schema).

Star schema is a modeling approach widely adopted by relational data warehouses. It requires modelers to classify their model tables as either dimension or fact.

Dimension tables describe business entities ‚Äî the things you model. Entities can include products, people, places, and concepts including time itself. A dimension table contains a key column (or columns) that acts as a unique identifier and descriptive columns.

Fact tables store observations or events and can be sales orders, stock balances, exchange rates, temperatures, etc. A fact table contains dimension key columns that relate to dimension tables and numeric measure columns.

Generally, dimension tables contain a relatively small number of rows. Fact tables, on the other hand, can contain a very large number of rows and continue to grow over time.

<br>

You uploaded Population Dataset that contains multiple datasheets. You want to create a union betweens these data sources to use them together.

To do this, you must remember the basics of joins. For this, we must have a field that we will use as the main connection on each one (primary key) which will be used as the unique field and main table to join between all the other ones.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_id_1.png)

<br>

In PowerBI you must have _one unique field to join your tables_. So be sure to have one to be used as a master table. For this case, in `total_pop` and `pop_fem_fam` datasets you will create some Primary keys that will help you to join them with financials. The key must be your locations and time because it'll help you to identify which are the unique fields inside each one.

Now, to join them, you just have to go to the Model Tab (left side of PowerBI).

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_model.png)

<br>

In there, you will see the whole datasets that you have inside your PowerBI desktop session. You can drag and drop each field to another to create the relationships or select a dataset and click on "Manage relationships".

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_relationships.png)

<br>

It will open the page to create your relationships and in there you can match your primary with your foreign keys. Create them and Power BI will recognize the unions between the data.

<br>

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_relations_3.png)

<br>

Once you've done this, you will see your relationships map.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day4_relations_map.png)

<br>

With this, you've been through all the joins to create the relations between multiple tables.

- What are Primary Keys and Foreign keys?
- What are some of their important properties?

Primary keys are used to uniquely identify every record in the table. By definition, they are UNIQUE and NOT NULL. They are used to establish relationships between tables, enforcing the data integrity constraints on the database as well. Primary keys also help with indexing which in turn helps to speed up queries, searches, and sorting through the data. Here are some of the properties of primary keys:

- There can only be one primary key for a table.
- The primary key consists of one or more columns.
- The primary key enforces the entity integrity of the table.
- The primary key uniquely identifies a row.

Foreign keys are the columns of a table that points to the primary key of another table so as to provides a link between data in two tables. The table containing the foreign key can be referred to as the child table, and the table containing the candidate key can be referred to as the referenced or parent table

Here are some of the properties of foreign keys:

- A relational FK references a relational PK
- A FK's referencing column types agree with corresponding referenced column types
- It should protect the referential integrity of the data ie an FK's referencing column values must appear as corresponding referenced column values
