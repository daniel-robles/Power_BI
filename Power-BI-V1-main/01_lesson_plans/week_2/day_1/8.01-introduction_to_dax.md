> :exclamation: We will use `financial_sample.xlsx` file. The same file was used during previous classes, but in case you need to download it once again, you can find it [here](https://github.com/haggarw3/Power-BI-V1/blob/main/01_lesson_plans/week_1/day_2/files_for_lessons_and_activities/Financial_sample.xlsx). Load the file in Power BI.

- DAX (Data Analysis Expression) is a group of expressions and functions which use a specific calculation/formula to get a result. This is really useful when we are dealing with large amounts of data and the calculations to be done are needed to be executed fast or to be dynamic.

- DAX works with two data types (primary), and these are:

  - _numeric_ - include integers, decimals, floats, etc.
  - _non-numeric_ - include strings and binary.

- The way DAX works is from innermost expression to the outermost, and this is something to keep in mind when creating these expressions.

- One of the most important characteristics of DAX is that it could be used when we want to create mathematical analysis, an average of attributes, trends, complement the information, validate your columns, and so on. It is important and relevant to learn how it could be accomplished using DAX.

### DAX Context

Having clear the DAX context will help us to understand how to use DAX syntax and how it works with Power BI. We have two types of context:

- **Row Context**
  We talk about Raw Context when we add a column to a table. When a new column is added we will be able to see the values in the new column that correspond to each value from the old column.
  This is like an iteration on rows.
  If you create a formula in a calculated column, the row context for that formula includes the values from all columns in the current row.

- **Filter Context**
  Filter context is added when you specify filter constraints on the set of values allowed in a column or table, by using arguments in a formula.
  Filter context applies on top of row context.

> :exclamation: Note to the instructor: Please refer to the following link to read more on DAX context: [Context in DAX formulas by Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/context-in-dax-formulas-2728fae0-8309-45b6-9d32-1d600440a7ad)

<br>

We can use DAX for creating:

- calculated columns
- calculated measures

<br>

> :exclamation: Note to the instructor: We touched upon calculated columns very briefly last week. Reference the last week's class materials to refresh the scope of covered materials.

### Different DAX functions

Before talking about calculated columns in more detail, let's talk about different DAX functions.  
These are predefined formulas that perform calculations with the arguments you provided to them. These arguments need to be in a particular order and from a particular data type.

- It could be a reference to another column

<br>

### Calculated columns

A calculated column is an extension of a table, which means it's added and evaluated using the value of each row indicated in the column. They live in the memory of Power BI and computational meaning, it's the same as a normal column of a table with the difference that, for a calculated column, we use DAX to get the values.

Steps to follow:

1. First you must select the dataset you're going to use in the Fields section, then click New Columns:

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day1_calculated_column_1.png)

<br>

2. Then you write your DAX formula, and when done, just press enter and you will see the result in the column you just created.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day1_calculated_column_2.png)

The formula is: `Column = financials[Units Sold] \* financials[Sale Price]`.

For this activity use the `financial_sample.xlsx` file. Load this file into Power BI. Table "Financials" has a few columns that have information as strings. Using the data in this table answer the following question:

- What is the number of Unique values in each of these columns and what are those values?

For example, column "Segment" has 5 distinct values. Those values are Government, MidMarket, Small Business, Enterprise, and Channel Parters.

</details>

### Session 2

> üï∞Ô∏è 40 min

#### Key Concepts

- DAX Basics

<details>
<summary> Click for details: DAX Basics part 1</summary>

<br>
    
We are going to see here the DAX functions types:

### Date and Time

The date and time functions apply calculations on the date and time values. The data type must be always _datetime_ or date type:

- Calendar
- DATE
- MONTH
- NOW
- Today

### Time Intelligence

Time Intelligence is used to evaluate values over a fixed period like days. You can specify a time using these functions and compare two scenarios in your report:

- `ENDOFMONTH`
- `DATEADD`
- `DATESBETWEEN`

### Information

This function provides information on the data values contained in rows and columns. It evaluates the given condition as a function for the value given and returns TRUE or FALSE. For example, the function `ISBLANK` will return `TRUE` if the value evaluated contains a _"blank"_ value.

- `ISTEXT`
- `ISBLANK`
- `ISERROR`

### Logical

This function is used to evaluate an expression or argument logically and returns `TRUE` or `FALSE` if the condition is met or not.

- `AND`
- `FALSE`
- `IF`

### Mathematical

This function is used to perform all sorts of mathematical operations on the referred values.

- `DIVIDE`
- `ABS`
- `COS`

### Statistical

This function performs statistical and aggregation functions.

- `COUNT`
- `SUM`
- `MAX`

### Text functions

These functions are very similar to Excel functions that work with strings.

- `LOWER`
- `MID`
- `REPLACE`

<br>

Now that we have seen how we can create a column using DAX, we are going to see some important functions that are really useful when working with DAX.

### Aggregate Functions

These functions return a result of the calculation grouped by a specific field. For example, `MIN` will return the minimal value from the column where it was applied or `SUM` will return the sum of values of the column where it was applied.

- `MIN`: Returns the minimum value
- `MAX`: Returns the maximum value
- `Average`: Returns the average value
- `SUM`: Returns sum of the value.

### Counting Functions

These functions are helpful when we want to know what is the count or how many elements there are of a specific type. For example, if we do a `COUNT` of the column ID, it will give us the total count of IDs that we have.

- `COUNT`: count values
- `DISTINCTCOUNT`: count unique values
- `COUNTBLANK`: count blank values

### Logical Functions

These functions are used together with functions where we want to apply filters to the DAX calculation. For example, _if_ some value1 equals to some other value2 then this function should return 1 else it will return 0. The correct syntax in DAX is: `IF(value1=value,1,0)`.

- `AND`: it adds another reference to our filters
- `OR`: makes us be one or another when filtering
- `IF`: checks if the condition is fulfilled
- `IFERROR`: checks if an attribute is an error.

<br>

We are going to see some examples applied, you just need to create a new column and type the expression for each one of the following:

<br>

- IF:

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day1_if.png)

<br>

- SUM:

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day1_sum.png)

<br>

- MIN:

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day1_min.png)

<br>

```DAX
IF = IF(financials[Sale Price]=10,1,0)
SUM = SUM(financials[Gross Sales])
min = MIN(financials[Gross Sales])
```

<br>

In this activity, we will use simple functions to create calculated columns.

1. Create a column called Month that stores that Month Values from the column "Date" in the Financials table.
2. We spoke about IF condition earlier in the lesson.
   - What are nested IF Statements?
   - Can the nested IF else statements be used in Power BI?
   - Can you use a Switch statement to create another column with the name "Month_names" that will use information from the "Month" column to display the actual names of the months?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Click for Solution: Activity 2 solutions</summary>

1. Correct syntax: `month = MONTH(financials[Date])`
2. Answers:

   - Yes, Power BI can have nested IF statements.
   - Switch statement

   ```
   Month Names = SWITCH(financials[month], 1, "January", 2, "February", 3, "March", 4, "April"
               , 5, "May", 6, "June", 7, "July", 8, "August"
               , 9, "September", 10, "October", 11, "November", 12, "December"
               , "Unknown month number" )
   ```

#### Key Concepts

<details>

<br>

### Text functions

These are used for text operations and are useful to homologate and clean the fields.

- `Replace`: it replaces the determined string with another value
- `Upper`: convert all string to upper
- `Fixed`: rounds a value
- `Concatenate`: it concatenates multiple strings into one.

### Information functions

These functions help us to know easily the data types or data structures we are working with. Using these functions, we can easily detect blank values, text values, number values... This can help us, for example, to detect text values in a field where the only number should be.

- `ISNUMBER`: returns _true_ if it is a number, otherwise returns _false_
- `ISTEXT`: returns _true_ if it is a text, otherwise returns _false_
- `ISBLANK`: returns _true_ if it is a blank field, otherwise returns _false_
- `ISNONTEXT`: returns _true_ if it is not text, otherwise returns _false_

### Date functions

These are helpful when we want to deal with date type and we need more detail about it. Remember that for correct usage the field must be datatype.

- `DATE`: converts to the date of the string received
- `MONTH`: returns the month of a date field
- `YEAR`: returns the year of a date field
- `NOW`: returns current date in DateTime format

We are going to see some examples applied - you just need to create a new column and type the expression for each one of the following:

- REPLACE:

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day1_replace.png)

<br>

- ISNUM:

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day1_isnum.png)

<br>

- DATE:

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day1_date.png)

<br>

- NOW:

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day1_now.png)

<br>

```dax
REPLACE = REPLACE(financials[Product],1,4,"Road")
isnum = ISNUMBER(financials[Date])
DATE_c = DATE(2021,12,3)
NOW = NOW()
```

<br>

Finally, we are going to create an example using DAX functions seen before:

1. First, create a column that contains the only month from the Date field.

</details>

<br>

4. Once it's done, create a bar chart where we can see the unique products per Month (that were sold for each month).

</details>

<br>

6. Now create a linechart where you will be able to see per month how much did we sell on the average per register in our dataset.

Demonstrate how you can use text functions in Power BI. What could be some possible use cases of using the text functions? For eg., if we have two separate columns, like First Name and Last Name, we can concatenate the two columns to get the complete name. Another sample use case would be to standardize data for analysis. For eg if there is a column called Gender, and there are typos in the column like M, male, Male, MALE, Mel, etc... This can of information can be standardized. Keep adding more.

<br>

> :exclamation: Note to the instructor: You can ask each student to demonstrate one text function they used with the data at hand. Each student should give one example of a possible use case.

- Standardize: Make everything into one case, either upper case or lower case.
- Extract relevant information from text using Left, Right.
- Clean white spaces in text using `trim`.
- Substitute information not required with what is required.
- You can also create more complex expressions by combining two or more functions.
