# Lesson 8.2 - DAX 2

<br><br>

### Lesson Duration: 4 hours (including Lab)

<br>

- **Purpose**: The purpose of this lesson is to get familiarized with more DAX functions and equip students with skills to perform advanced calculations using Power BI.

<br>

## Pre-requisites

To successfully take this class, the students would need:

- Completed all previous lessons
- Power BI desktop
- Access to all datasets used in class and lab (students have access to this [repository](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/power-bi-resources) - liked to their Student Portal)

---

## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:

- Apply calculated measures and `CALCULATE` DAX function to perform calculations in Power BI.

### Session 1

#### Key Concepts

- Calculated Measures
- The `CALCULATE` function

<br>
    
A calculated measure is not yet another calculated column in the table (like the ones we saw before). The calculated measures are **calculated at the moment, dynamically**. This means every time something changes on the information (for instance, a filter is applied), it will recalculate the corresponding value using the DAX functions. Be careful because this uses more resources than calculated columns. And remember, each measure must be used as an aggregation, or, if not, it'll be an error.
    
When to use Calculated Column or Calculated Measures?
- Note that the computational cost of measures are higher than columns
- Measures can not be used as filters in slicers nor report pages.
- If your calculations need to change constantly, use measures.

<br>
    
This is a table expression where the filter is applied to a table object. You can use the FILTER function to apply complex filter conditions. More than one filter can be applied in the same function by using logical operators. 
    
This is the syntax for Calculate function: **`CALCULATE( <expression>, <filter1>, <filter2>‚Ä¶ )`**
   
**Note**: The expression used in the first parameter has to be evaluated to return the result that is a value and not a table. Hence, the expression is usually an aggregation function like `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNTROWS`, etc. This expression is evaluated in a context that is modified by the filters. 
    
The `CALCULATE` function can be used without filters and in that case, it achieves a specific requirement. It transitions row context to filter context. It's required when an expression that summarizes model data needs to be evaluated in a row context. This scenario can happen in a calculated column formula or when an expression in an iterator function is evaluated. Simply, put this is like a calculated measure that we saw earlier.

Now, let's try to understand it with a few examples.

> :exclamation: Note for instructor: We will be using the Financials table.

<br>

#### Using the single filter criteria

<br>

The goal we want to achieve in our analysis is the Total Units Sold for a particular country. Click on "New Measure" and add the formula:

```
units_sold_germany = CALCULATE(SUM(financials[Units Sold]), financials[Country]= "Germany")
```

<br>

<br>

When you click on the created measure in the Fields pane on the right-hand side, it will open the "Measure Tools" option. You can modify some properties of the measure you created.

<br>

<br>

As you will note, it doesn't create a new column because it will be calculated only when is used.

<br>

#### Using the multiple field criteria

<br>

Now, let's say we only want the Total Units Sold for a particular country for a particular discount band. Create a new measure as shown below:

```
units_sold_germany_discountBand = CALCULATE(SUM(financials[Units Sold]), financials[Country]="Germany", financials[Discount Band]="Low")
```

You can also use variables in your DAX to achieve the same results:

**Note**: Use `SHIFT + ENTER` to move to the next line in the DAX formula bar editor.

```
units_test=
var band = "Low"
return
CALCULATE(SUM(financials[Units Sold]), financials[Country]="Germany", financials[Discount Band]= band
```

<br>

Now take a look at the following example. Here we want to calculate the profit for the year 2014.

- First, create a column that gives us the YEAR of the Date field.

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day1_year.png)

<br>

- Then, in calculations, click the NEW MEASURE option. Now enter your code:

<br>

![Image](https://education-team-2020.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/power-bi/week-2/day1_last_year.png)

<br>

```
last_year_profit =
//Defining current dates as First January 2015
 VAR
   CurrentDate = "01/01/2015"
//Calculating profit where year is equal to CurrentDate variable -1
 RETURN
   CALCULATE(
    SUM(financials[Profit]),
    financials[Year] = YEAR(CurrentDate)-1
   )
```
