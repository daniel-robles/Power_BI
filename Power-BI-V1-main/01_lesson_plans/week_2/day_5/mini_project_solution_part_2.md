### Data sources

<br>

We are going to use **`mini_project2_sample_data.pbix`** file. You can find this file in the [Power BI resources](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/power-bi-resources) repository.

Here you will find information on the sales of certain products made by some manufacturers across North America (US, Mexico, and Canada) and in Europe (France and Germany).
A sales table is a calculated table that consists of other calculated columns from other tables in the dataset. You can go through the formulas in the table to check DAX formulas for them.

### Objective

Your objective will be to re-create a report as shown below. You can either rewrite DAX formulas yourself or you can use the existing calculations provided in the model. To check the relationship between tables, you can click on the "Model" tab. Here is a screenshot of the relationship diagram between the tables.
