## Power BI DAX Math Functions

> :exclamation: Note to the instructor: We will cover DAX in greater detail later, but for now, you can tell students they should think about them as a kind of calculated column.

You can use the "dax_math" file to check the math functions created, which are shown below.

The mathematical functions in Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) are very similar to the Excel mathematical and trigonometric functions. There is a lot of math function but we only review a few that are the most commonly used.

> :exclamation: Note to the instructor: For this activity, we will use the "employees.csv" file. Students will have this file available in the **[Power BI resources](https://github.com/ironhack-edu/power-bi-resources)** repository too. As you can see, there are only 15 records in this table.

To demonstrate the Power BI DAX Math functions, we are going to use the below-shown data:

<br>

<br>

## Date time functions

These functions help you create calculations based on dates and time. Many of the functions in DAX are similar to the Excel date and time functions. However, DAX functions use a date-time data type and can take values from a column as an argument.

### DATE

- Returns the specified date in datetime format.
- Syntax: **`DATE(<year>, <month>, <day>)`**

- Definitions of terms:
  - _year_ - A number representing the year.
  - _month_ - Negative integers are not supported. Valid values are 1-12.
  - _day_ - Negative integers are not supported. Valid values are 1-31.

### DATETIFF

- Returns the count of interval boundaries crossed between two dates.
- Syntax: **`DATEDIFF(<start_date>, <end_date>, <interval>)`**

### DATEVALUE

- Converts a date in text format to date in DateTime format.
- Syntax: **`DATEVALUE(date_text)`**

### DAY

- Returns the day of the month, a number from 1 to 31.
- Syntax: **`DAY(<date>)`**

### EDATE

- Returns the date that is the indicated number of months before or after the start date.
- Use EDATE to calculate maturity dates or due dates that fall on the same day of the month as the date of issue.
- Syntax: **`EDATE(<start_date>, <months>)`**

### EOMONTH

- Returns the date in DateTime format of the last day of the month, before or after a specified number of months.
- Use EOMONTH to calculate maturity dates or due dates that fall on the last day of the month.
- Syntax: **`EOMONTH(<start_date>, <months>)`**

### HOUR

- Returns the hour as a number from 0 (12:00 A.M.) to 23 (11:00 P.M.).
- Syntax: **`HOUR(<datetime>)`**

### MINUTE

- Returns the minute as a number from 0 to 59, given a date and time value.
- Syntax: **`MINUTE(<datetime>)`**

### MONTH

- Returns the month as a number from 1 (January) to 12 (December).
- Syntax: **`MONTH(<datetime>)`**

### NOW

- Returns the current date and time in DateTime format.
- The NOW function is useful when you need to display the current date and time on a worksheet or calculate a value based on the current date and time, and have that value updated each time you open the worksheet.
- Syntax: **`NOW()`**

### TODAY

- Returns the current date.
- Syntax: **`TODAY()`**
